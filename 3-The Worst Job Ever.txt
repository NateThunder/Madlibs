The Worst Job Ever

My first day at my new job was 1. The office was filled with 2, and the manager 3 before I even sat down.

My workload was 4, and I was given a 5 instead of a computer. The printer kept spitting out 6, and my coworkers were too busy 7 to help.

At one point, 8 walked in, screaming about 9, and threw a stapler at me.

This job is 0, but at least I get free coffee.
