The Worst First Date

Last night, I went on the most 1 date ever. My date took me to 2, which was already a bad sign. Then, they 3 before we even ordered food, which made things 4 really fast.

They insisted on ordering 5, which smelled like 6. Instead of talking, they just kept 7 awkwardly.

Then, 8 showed up at the table and shouted, "9!" before stealing my 0 and running away.

Never dating again.
