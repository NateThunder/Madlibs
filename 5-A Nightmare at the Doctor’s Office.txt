A Nightmare at the Doctorâ€™s Office

My check-up was 1. The room was filled with 2, and the doctor 3 before even asking my name.

The exam felt 4, especially when he checked my 5 with a 6.

Meanwhile, the nurse was too busy 7 to help. Then, 8 walked in and handed me a prescription for 9.

Apparently, my condition is 0. I think I need a second opinion.
