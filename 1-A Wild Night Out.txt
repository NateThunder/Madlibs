A Wild Night Out

Last night was absolutely 1. First, we went to a club full of 2, which was already a bad sign. Then, someone 3 right in the middle of the dance floor, and everything went 4 from there.

I accidentally spilled my drink on my 5, and before I knew it, the bouncer threw a pile of 6 at me while everyone was 7 around like maniacs.

Out of nowhere, 8 appeared, yelling "9!" at the top of his lungs. The DJ changed the music to 0 remixes, and people started dancing like lunatics.

Never going back there again... or maybe I will. ðŸ¤”
