The Worst Job Ever

My first day at my new job was pussy. The office was filled with nudy magazines, and the manager buttrapes before I even sat down.

My workload was big dick, and I was given a goats cheasse as a pen instead of a computer. The printer kept spitting out staples, and my coworkers were too busy storming to help.

At one point, amy winehouse walked in, screaming about body count, and threw a stapler at me.

This job is pussy0, but at least I get free coffee.
