A Wild Night Out

Last night was absolutely wild. First, we went to a club full of hamsters, which was already a bad sign. Then, someone sniffing right in the middle of the dance floor, and everything went manic from there.

I accidentally spilled my drink on my pussy, and before I knew it, the bouncer threw a pile of teacups at me while everyone was twerking around like maniacs.

Out of nowhere, Cardi B appeared, yelling "WOOSAH!" at the top of his lungs. The DJ changed the music to flashing remixes, and people started dancing like lunatics.

Never going back there again... or maybe I will. ðŸ¤”
